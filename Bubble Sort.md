# Bubble Sort

## Overview

Bubble Sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm used to arrange elements of a list in a specified order (ascending or descending). The algorithm repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.

## How It Works

1. **Compare Adjacent Elements:** Start at the beginning of the list and compare each pair of adjacent elements.
2. **Swap If Necessary:** If the elements are in the wrong order (e.g., the first element is greater than the second in an ascending sort), swap them.
3. **Repeat:** Continue the process until the end of the list is reached.
4. **Repeat the Entire Process:** After each pass through the list, the largest unsorted element is moved to its correct position. This means each pass requires fewer comparisons.
5. **Termination:** The algorithm stops when a complete pass is made without any swaps, indicating that the list is sorted.

## Characteristics

- **Simplicity:** Bubble Sort is easy to understand and implement, making it suitable for educational purposes.
- **Performance:** It has a time complexity of O(n²) in both the average and worst cases, where n is the number of items being sorted. It performs well for small datasets but is inefficient for large ones.
- **Stability:** Bubble Sort is a stable sort, meaning that it preserves the relative order of equal elements.

## Use Cases

- **Educational Purposes:** Ideal for teaching the basics of sorting algorithms.
- **Small Datasets:** Suitable for scenarios where the dataset is small and simplicity is preferred over performance.

## Limitations

- **Inefficiency with Large Datasets:** Due to its O(n²) time complexity, Bubble Sort is not practical for large datasets where more efficient algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort are preferred.

## Conclusion

Bubble Sort is a simple yet educational sorting algorithm that demonstrates the fundamental concept of sorting through iterative comparison and swapping. While not suitable for large-scale applications due to its inefficiency, it serves as a valuable tool for understanding basic sorting principles.
